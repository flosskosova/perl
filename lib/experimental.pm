=head1 NAME

experimental - Enable experimental features

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use experimental 'XXX';
    # XXX feature enabled here

    {
        no experimental 'XXX';
        # temporarily disabled
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This pragma enables or disables experimental features in Perl.  These are
features that may be modified or removed in future Perl versions.  Some new
features are put here to be tested first before being upgraded to
"accepted" status.  Feel free to use these features in your own personal
experiments, but beware of using them in production code!

This:

    use experimental 'foo';

is actually equivalent to:

    use feature 'experimental::foo';
